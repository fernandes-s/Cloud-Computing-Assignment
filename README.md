# Cloud Computing Assignment

## Background of the enterprise 
I currently work in a company called Galway Bay Brewery who describe themselves as: 
>“…an independently owned and operated brewery based in Galway, on the west coast of Ireland. From classic styles to big barrel aged beers, we brew the full spectrum of beer with a passion for quality and innovation.” [1]

After a merge with Bru Brewery, Galway Bay Brewery now operates fifteen pubs throughout Ireland with twelve of them being based in Dublin, two in Galway and one in Belfast.

## Current IT setup
My role as a manager in The Beer Temple (one of the company’s pubs) gives me access to some of its data, such as its IT set-up. The company has its IT set-up managed by Nostra which is:
>“…a world leading managed IT services company, with the expertise and know-how to help your business prosper in a connected world” [2]. 

Nostra provides security and compliance services such as cyber risk assessment, network monitoring and cyber security protection. They also supply network and infrastructure services such as physical and wireless networks, network design, upgrade, and maintenance. [2] Even though our internet is provided by Virgin Media Ireland Limited [3], the router hardware is supplied by Nostra. They also provide our server where all the sales data is stored within the pub’s facilities.
The data entry is made through the EPoS (electronic point of sale) and the system is supplied by CBE:
>“…one of the leading innovators in retail technology in Europe and first choice for EPoS solutions in Ireland & the UK” [4] 

and stored in the server provided by Nostra.

## Recommendations
Based on the company’s current IT set-up, I would recommend:

Applying Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) measures. [5]

With IaaS we can: reduce costs with servers using the pay as you go subscription models, increase stability, reliability, and supportability. We can use its scalability to just use as much as we need and not have to pay for more storage than we are actually using. It would also prevent the loss of the data due the backups made through cloud and enhances security. [6]

With SaaS we can: gain access to different applications, therefore, be allowed to use a free client software, it will help the company to save in software and not have to purchase them all, access the data from anywhere because it will be stored in the cloud and there will be no need to go in-site to access the data. The fact that the data would be stored in the cloud would give easier access from home offices and allow the company to expand within the country and even start to export its products worldwide. [7]

These changes would add a lot to the company and would drive not only our sales, but better organize our stock and increase profits, keep system and software updated and make data driven decisions such as which beer should we produce based on pub sales, and show what is in demand.
