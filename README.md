# Cloud Computing Assignment

## Background of the enterprise 
I currently work in a company called Galway Bay Brewery, and on the company’s website they describe themselves as 
>“…an independently owned and operated brewery based in Galway, on the west coast of Ireland. From classic styles to big barrel aged beers, we brew the full spectrum of beer with a passion for quality and innovation.” [1]

after a merge with Bru Brewery, Galway Bay Brewery now operates 15 pubs over Ireland with 12 of them being based in Dublin, 2 in Galway and one in Belfast.

## Current IT setup
My role as a manager in The Beer Temple (one of the company’s pubs) gives me access to some of its data, such as its IT set-up. The company has its IT set-up managed by Nostra which is 
>“…a world leading managed IT services company, with the expertise and know-how to help your business prosper in a connected world” [2]. 

Nostra provides security and compliance services such as cyber risk assessment, network monitoring and cyber security protection. They also supply Network and Infrastructure services such as, physical, and wireless network, network design, upgrade, and maintenance. [2] Even though our internet is provided by Virgin Media Ireland Limited [3], the router hardware is supplied by Nostra. They also provide our server where all the sales data is stored within the pub’s facilities.
The data entry is made through the EPoS (electronic point of sale) and the system is supplied by CBE 
>“…one of the leading innovators in retail technology in Europe and first choice for EPoS solutions in Ireland & the UK” [4] 

and stored in the server provided by Nostra.
