I Currently work in a Company Called Galway Bay Brewery. This company owns two breweries, one in Galway and the Other in Meath they also own fifteen pubs around Ireland. Unfortunately, they have no cloud system to connect its pubs nor breweries, which makes ordering stock a hard process and help between pubs even harder. Even though our POS is administered by Nostra that is a world leading managed IT services company [1], they do not provide this service of integrating the company’s wholes system. 

•	With a cloud system implanted in the company:
•	It would be easier to escalate in busy periods (Pay-per-use-IT) such as, St. Patrick Day, Pride or Christmas. 
•	It can also be future proof, due the fact that the business manager won’t have to worry about updating the system he will have access to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). 
•	Access to documents will be made easier once the data is in the cloud you will be able to look at it and make data driven decisions. [2]
