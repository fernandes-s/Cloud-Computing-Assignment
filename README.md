#Cloud Computing Assignment

##•	Background of the enterprise 
-I currently work in a company called Galway Bay Brewery, and on the company’s website they describe themselves as 
>“…an independently owned and operated brewery based in Galway, on the west coast of Ireland. From classic styles to big barrel aged beers, we brew the full spectrum of beer with a passion for quality and innovation.” [1], 
-after a merge with Bru Brewery, Galway Bay Brewery now operates 15 pubs over Ireland with 12 of them being based in Dublin, 2 in Galway and one in Belfast.

##•	Current IT setup
-My role as a manager in The Beer Temple (one of the company’s pubs) gives me access to some of its data, such as its IT set-up. The company has its IT set-up managed by Nostra which is “…a world leading managed IT services company, with the expertise and know-how to help your business prosper in a connected world” [2]. 
The Beer Temple IT set-up has a server installed within the pub’s facilities. All the sales data is stored in the pub, which give us access to figures, waste, peak times etc. We complete our data entry through the POS (point of sale) and it is connected with the server that then stores the data.
